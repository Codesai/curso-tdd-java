### Constraints.

Aside from its constructor this is the only public method of the `Alarm` class:

`void check()`

`Alarm` cannot have any accessor methods to see its state, and all its fields must be private.

### Tools

[Use of test doubles with Mockito](https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/1573df976f090f46f3b188646de8b3be)
