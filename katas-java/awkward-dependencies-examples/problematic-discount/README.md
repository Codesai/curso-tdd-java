# Problematic Discount example

## Goal
Recognizing awkward dependencies (FIRS violations).

1. Examine the code and the tests that are disabled. 

   a. Can you write those disabled unit tests?

   b. If not, identify which violations of FIRS make the code not unit-testable.

2. Optional: how would you design this code in order to be unit-testable?
