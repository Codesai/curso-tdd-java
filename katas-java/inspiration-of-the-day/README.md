Inspiration of the day
================

Problem Description
-------------------

You are to write a service that, every time it gets executed,
connects to a web service that returns a list of quotes
containing a word chosen by a manager,
then it randomly selects one quote from the list
and sends it by WhatsApp to a random employee
so that that employee gets inspired and motivated by the manager.


### Constraints

The entry point of the service only has this public method: `void inspireSomeone(String word);`
